/* Sleep Demo Serial
 * -----------------
 * Example code to demonstrate the sleep functions in a Arduino.
 *
 * use a resistor between RX and pin2. By default RX is pulled up to 5V
 * therefore, we can use a sequence of Serial data forcing RX to 0, what
 * will make pin2 go LOW activating INT0 external interrupt, bringing
 * the MCU back to life
 *
 * there is also a time counter that will put the MCU to sleep after 10secs
 *
 * NOTE: when coming back from POWER-DOWN mode, it takes a bit
 *       until the system is functional at 100%!! (typically <1sec)

 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  This new version introduces the sensors reading feature
 *  when the micro wakes up, it reads the sensors values and send them
 *  over the serial port.
 *  
 *  To wake up the micro, you just have to send any data over the serial port, 
 *  so when you want to read the sensors, you send any serial data to the mote
 *  and it'll wake up, send data and back to sleep
